# **Spring**

## **Autowire**

*Autowiring** feature of **spring** framework enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly. It internally uses setter or constructor injection. **Autowiring can**'t be used to inject primitive and string values.



## 什么是Spring Boot

Spring Boot 是由 Pivotal 团队提供的全新框架，其设计目的是用来简化新 Spring 应用的初始搭建以及开发过程。该框架使用了特定的方式来进行配置，从而使开发人员不再需要定义样板化的配置。用我的话来理解，就是 Spring Boot 其实不是什么新的框架，它默认配置了很多框架的使用方式，就像 Maven 整合了所有的 Jar 包，Spring Boot 整合了所有的框架。

Spring Boot provides a good platform for Java developers to develop a stand-alone spring application that you can just run. You can get started with minimum configurations without the need for an entire Spring configuration setup. 

- Easy to understand and develop spring applications
- Increases productivity
- Reduces the development time



## **Spring Boot 重要的三个Annotation：**

@Configuration(@SpringBootConfiguration实质就是一个@Configuration）
@EnableAutoConfiguration
@ComponentScan

**@Configuration**

这个注解实际上就是代表了一个配置类，相当于一个beans.xml文件

**@EnableAutoConfiguration**

**@ComponentScan**

@ComponentScan这个注解在Spring中很重要，它对应XML配置中的元素，@ComponentScan的功能其实就是自动扫描并加载符合条件的组件（比如@Component和@Repository等）或者bean定义，最终将这些bean定义加载到IoC容器中。

我们可以通过basePackages等属性来细粒度的定制@ComponentScan自动扫描的范围，如果不指定，则默认Spring框架实现会从声明@ComponentScan所在类的package进行扫描。



## **SpringBoot Auto config**

spring boot 的 auto-configuration 功能会根据你的应用程序所依赖的 pom 来进行自动配置。

1. SpringBoot  启动时会加载大量的自动配置类
2. 我们看我们需要的功能中有没有SpringBoot默认写好的自动配置类
3. 我们再看自动配置类中是否有我们需要的组件(如果有就不需要我们手动配置)
4. Springboot会将配置类加载到ioc容器中, 我们可以直接在spring配置文件中指定某些属性的值(例如 spring.http.encoding.charset=utf-8)

xxxxAutoConfiguration: 自动配置类; 给ioc容器添加组件

xxxxProperties: 封装文件中的相关属性



## @Component, @Repository, @Service的区别

| 注解        | 含义                                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| @Component  | 最普通的组件，可以被注入到spring容器进行管理 |
| @Repository | 作用于持久层                                 |
| @Service    | 作用于业务逻辑层                             |
| @Controller | 作用于表现层（spring-mvc的注解）             |

@Component:We can use @Component annotation to mark a bean as a **Spring-managed component**. 

@Repository:This annotation is a specialization over @Component annotation. @Repository is a stereotype for the **persistence layer**. Its job is to catch all persistence related exceptions and rethrow them as a Spring DataAccessException.

@Service:Just like @Repository, @Service is another specialization of @Component. The @Service annotation represents that our bean **holds some business logic**. 



## Java监听器Listener

监听器用于监听web应用中某些对象、信息的创建、销毁、增加，修改，删除等动作的发生，然后作出相应的响应处理。当范围对象的状态发生变化的时候，服务器自动调用监听器对象中的方法。常用于统计在线人数和在线用户，系统加载时进行信息初始化，统计网站的访问量等等。

The listener is used to listen certain objects in the web application. For example once information gets creation, destruction, addition, modification, deletion and other actions, and it will respond accordingly. It is often used to count the number of online users, initialize the information when the system loads, and count the visits to the website etc.

Spring allows us to create listeners in the code. We can create beans that listen for events which are published through our ApplicationContext. This is achieved via the ApplicationEventPublisher interface. The ApplicationContext implements the above interface. Publisher, Event, ListenerPublisher -- Implement ApplicationEventPublisher Event - extends ApplicationEventListener - implement ApplciationListener

 

## Spring Profile

通过Profile配置，Spring可以在根据环境在运行阶段来决定bean的创建与否，

**通过注解@Profile配置**

**通过xml配置文件配置**

**profile激活**: 需要属性spring.profile.active

Spring `@Profile` allow developers to register beans by condition. 

Use \*@Profile\* on a Bean

Declare Profiles in XML

Spring Security is a powerful and highly customizable authentication and access-control framework. It is the standard for securing Spring-based applications. we can use @EnableWebSecurity to enable web security. to configure the security, we can either implements the interface called WebSecurityConfigurer or extend the more convenient class called WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter.The advantage of extending the adapter class is that we can configure Web security by overriding only those parts that we are interested in; others can remain their default form.

 

## **Spring Security** 

Spring Security是一个能够为基于Spring的企业应用系统提供声明式的安全访问控制解决方案的安全框架。一般来说，Web 应用的安全性包括用户认证（Authentication）和用户授权（Authorization）两个部分。对于上面提到的两种应用情景，Spring Security 框架都有很好的支持。在用户认证方面，Spring Security 框架支持主流的认证方式，包括 HTTP 基本认证、HTTP 表单验证、HTTP 摘要认证、OpenID 和 LDAP 等。在用户授权方面，Spring Security 提供了基于角色的访问控制和访问控制列表（Access Control List，ACL）

## **Spring MVC**

MVC（Model模型 View 视图 Controller 控制器）：这是一种软件架构思想，是一种开发模式，将软件划分为三种不同类型的模块，分别是模型，视图，和控制器。 模型：用于封装业务逻辑处理（java类）； 视图：用于数据展现和操作界面（Servlet）； 控制器：用于协调视图和模型（jsp）； 处理流程：视图将请求发送给控制器，由控制器选择对应的模型来处理；模型将处理结果交给控制器，控制器选择合适的视图来展现处理结果

**M 代表 模型（Model）**
 模型是什么呢？ 模型就是数据，就是 dao,bean

**V 代表 视图（View）**
 视图是什么呢？ 就是网页, JSP，用来展示模型中的数据

**C 代表 控制器（controller)**
 控制器是什么？ 控制器的作用就是把不同的数据(Model)，显示在不同的视图(View)上，Servlet 扮演的就是这样的角色。



# **Collections** 

## **Major Differences between ArrayList and Vector:**

1. Synchronization : Vector is synchronized, which means only one thread at a time can access the code, while arrayList is not synchronized, which means multiple threads can work on arrayList at the same time.
2. Performance: ArrayList is faster, since it is non-synchronized, while vector operations give slower performance since they are synchronized (thread-safe). If one thread works on a vector, it has acquired a lock on it, which forces any other thread wanting to work on it to have to wait until the lock is released.

1. Data Growth: ArrayList and Vector both grow and shrink dynamically to maintain optimal use of storage – but the way they resize is different. ArrayList increments 50% of the current array size if the number of elements exceeds its capacity, while vector increments 100% – essentially doubling the current array size.

1. Traversal: Vector can use both Enumeration and Iterator for traversing over elements of vector while ArrayList can only use Iterator for traversing.



## **Major Differences between ArrayList and LinkedList**

| ArrayList                                                    | LinkedList                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) ArrayList internally uses a **dynamic array** to store the elements. | LinkedList internally uses a **doubly linked list** to store the elements. |
| 2) Manipulation with ArrayList is **slow** because it internally uses an array. If any element is removed from the array, all the bits are shifted in memory. | Manipulation with LinkedList is **faster** than ArrayList because it uses a doubly linked list, so no bit shifting is required in memory. |
| 3) An ArrayList class can **act as a list** only because it implements List only. | LinkedList class can **act as a list and queue** both because it implements List and Deque interfaces. |
| 4) ArrayList is **better for storing and accessing** data.   | LinkedList is **better for manipulating** data.              |

## **Difference between HashMap and Hashtable**

HashMap and Hashtable both are used to store data in key and value form. Both are using hashing technique to store unique keys.

But there are many differences between HashMap and Hashtable classes that are given below.

| HashMap                                                      | Hashtable                                                    |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1) HashMap is **non synchronized**. It is not-thread safe and can't be shared between many threads without proper synchronization code. | Hashtable is **synchronized**. It is thread-safe and can be shared with many threads. |
| 2) HashMap **allows one null key and multiple null values**. | Hashtable **doesn't allow any null key or value**.           |
| 3) HashMap is a **new class introduced in JDK 1.2**.         | Hashtable is a **legacy class**.                             |
| 4) HashMap is **fast**.                                      | Hashtable is **slow**.                                       |
| 5) We can make the HashMap as synchronized by calling this code Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(hashMap); | Hashtable is internally synchronized and can't be unsynchronized. |
| 6) HashMap is **traversed by Iterator**.                     | Hashtable is **traversed by Enumerator and Iterator**.       |
| 7) Iterator in HashMap is **fail-fast**.                     | Enumerator in Hashtable is **not fail-fast**.                |
| 8) HashMap inherits **AbstractMap** class.                   | Hashtable inherits **Dictionary** class.                     |



## ConcurrentHashMap实现原理及源码分析 ⭐️

https://www.cnblogs.com/chengxiao/p/6842045.html



## **Difference between ConcurrentHashMap and Hashtable**

1) Hashtable is belongs to the Collection framework; ConcurrentHashMap belongs to the Executor framework.

2) Hashtable uses single lock for whole data. ConcurrentHashMap uses multiple locks on segment level (16 by default) instead of object level i.e. whole Map.

3) ConcurrentHashMap locking is applied only for updates. In case of retrievals, it allows full concurrency, retrievals reflect the results of the most recently completed update operations. So reads can happen very fast while writes are done with a lock.

4) ConcurrentHashMap doesn't throw a ConcurrentModificationException if one thread tries to modify it while another is iterating over it and does not allow null values.

5) ConcurrentHashMap returns Iterator, which fails-safe (i.e. iterator will make a copy of the internal data structure) on concurrent modification.

6) ConcurrentHashMap uses a database shards logic (Segment[] segments), i.e. divides the data into shards(segments) than puts locks on each shard (segment) instead of putting a single lock for whole data (Map).

7) ConcurrentHashMap is more efficient for threaded applications.



## **What is weakHashMap**

WeakHashMap is a Hash table-based implementation of the Map interface with weak keys. An entry in a WeakHashMap will automatically be removed when its key is no longer in ordinary use. Both null values and the null key are supported. This class has performance characteristics similar to those of the HashMap class and has the same efficiency parameters of initial capacity and load factor. Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized. A synchronized WeakHashMap may be constructed using the Collections.synchronizedMap method.

Weak Reference − if the only references to an object are weak references, the garbage collector can reclaim the object's memory at any time. It doesn't have to wait until the system runs out of memory. Usually, it will be freed the next time the garbage collector runs. This class is a member of the Java Collections Framework.



## **concurrent modificationException**

The ConcurrentModificationException is a RuntimeException that may be thrown by methods that have detected concurrent modification of an object, when such modification is not permissible. An example of not permissible behavior is when a thread tries to modify the internal structure of a Collection, while another thread is iterating over it.

In general, the results of the iteration are undefined. Some iterators throw a ConcurrentModificationException when they detect such behavior. These iterators are called fail-fast iterators, as they stop the normal execution to report an error, rather that continuing in a non-deterministic way. Notice that this exception does not indicate that the object has been concurrently modified by a different thread. The exception is thrown even one thread is violating an object’s contract.

## Java Thread Life Cycle States

![Java Thread Life Cycle States](https://howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Java-Thraed-Life-Cycle-States.jpg)

1. #### New

   As soon as, you [create new thread](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/multi-threading/difference-between-implements-runnable-and-extends-thread-in-java/), it’s in `NEW` state. It remains in this state until the program starts the thread using it’s `start()` method.

   At this point, thread is not alive and it’s a state internal to Java programming.

2. #### Runnable

   Calling `start()` method on thread put it in `RUNNABLE` state. At this point, execution control is passed to thread scheduler to finish it’s execution. Thread scheduler decide from this point that this thread should be executed (also known as dispatching the thread) or should be put on hold to give chance to other runnable threads.

   Thread scheduling is platform dependent — the behavior of a multi-threaded program could vary across different Java implementations.

   In most operating systems, each thread is given a small amount of processor time—called a quantum or timeslice—with which to perform its task. A task utilizing it’s quantum is said to be in `RUNNING` state. When its quantum expires, the thread returns to the `RUNNABLE` state, and the operating system assigns another thread to the processor.

   The process that an operating system uses to determine which thread to dispatch is called thread scheduling and is dependent on thread priorities.

   The operating system hide the RUNNABLE and RUNNING states from the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which sees only the RUNNABLE state.

   ![RUNNABLE VS RUNNING](https://howtodoinjava.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/RUNNABLE-VS-RUNNING.png)

3. #### Blocked

   A RUNNABLE thread transitions to the `BLOCKED` state when it attempts to perform a task that cannot be completed immediately and it must temporarily wait until that task completes.

   For example, when a thread issues an input/output request, the operating system blocks the thread from executing until that I/O request completes—at that point, the blocked thread transitions to the RUNNABLE state, so it can resume execution. A blocked thread cannot use a processor, even if one is available.

4. #### Waiting

   A thread can be put in waiting state for various reasons e.g. calling it’s `wait()` method. Usually program put a thread in WAIT state because something else needs to be done prior to what current thread is doing.

   Once the thread wait state is over or it is, it’s state is changed to `RUNNABLE` and it’s moved back to thread pool.

5. #### Timed Waiting

   A RUNNABLE thread can transition to the `TIMED WAITING` state if it provides an optional wait interval when it’s waiting for another thread to perform a task. You can put a java thread in `TIMED WAITING` state by calling it’s `sleep(long millis)` method or wait(long millis) method.

   Such a thread returns to the `RUNNABLE` state when it’s notified by another thread or when the timed interval expires—whichever comes first.

   Timed waiting threads and waiting threads cannot use a processor, even if one is available.

6. #### Terminated

   A thread enters the `TERMINATED` state (sometimes called the **dead state**) when it successfully completes its task or otherwise terminated due to any error or even it was forcefully killed.





## Synchronized

[Multi-threaded ](http://quiz.geeksforgeeks.org/multithreading-in-java/)programs may often come to a situation where multiple threads try to access the same resources and finally produce erroneous and unforeseen results.

So it needs to be made sure by some synchronization method that only one thread can access the resource at a given point of time.

Java provides a way of creating threads and synchronizing their task by using synchronized blocks. Synchronized blocks in Java are marked with the synchronized keyword. A synchronized block in Java is synchronized on some object. All synchronized blocks synchronized on the same object can only have one thread executing inside them at a time. All other threads attempting to enter the synchronized block are blocked until the thread inside the synchronized block exits the block.



## Deadlock 

Deadlock describes a situation where two or more threads are blocked forever, waiting for each other. Deadlock occurs when multiple threads need the same locks but obtain them in different order. A Java multithreaded program may suffer from the deadlock condition because the **synchronized** keyword causes the executing thread to block while waiting for the lock, or monitor, associated with the specified object.



## ExecutorService

The Java ExecutorService is a construct that allows you to pass a task to be executed by a thread asynchronously. The executor service creates and maintains a reusable pool of threads for executing submitted tasks. The service also manages a queue, which is used when there are more tasks than the number of threads in the pool and there is a need to queue up tasks until there is a free thread available to execute the task.



## CountDownLatch

CountDownLatch was introduced with JDK 1.5 along with other concurrent utilities like CyclicBarrier, Semaphore, ConcurrentHashMap and BlockingQueue in java.util.concurrent package. This class enables a java thread to wait until other set of threads completes their tasks. e.g. Application’s main thread want to wait, till other service threads which are responsible for starting framework services have completed started all services.

CountDownLatch works by having a counter initialized with number of threads, which is decremented each time a thread complete its execution. When count reaches to zero, it means all threads have completed their execution, and thread waiting on latch resume the execution.



## Locks

A lock is a thread synchronization mechanism like synchronized blocks except locks can be more sophisticated than Java's synchronized blocks. Locks (and other more advanced synchronization mechanisms) are created using synchronized blocks, so it is not like we can get totally rid of the synchronized keyword.



## mutex

In a multithreaded application, two or more threads may need to access a shared resource at the same time, resulting in unexpected behavior. Examples of such shared resources are data-structures, input-output devices, files, and network connections.

We call this scenario a race condition. And, the part of the program which accesses the shared resource is known as the critical section. So, to avoid a race condition, we need to synchronize access to the critical section.

A mutex (or mutual exclusion) is the simplest type of synchronizer – it ensures that only one thread can execute the critical section of a computer program at a time.

To access a critical section, a thread acquires the mutex, then accesses the critical section, and finally releases the mutex. In the meantime, all other threads block till the mutex releases. As soon as a thread exits the critical section, another thread can enter the critical section.



## producer-consumer problem 

In computing, the producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem. The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue.

- The producer’s job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.
- At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time.

**Solution**
The producer is to either go to sleep or discard data if the buffer is full. The next time the consumer removes an item from the buffer, it notifies the producer, who starts to fill the buffer again. In the same way, the consumer can go to sleep if it finds the buffer to be empty. The next time the producer puts data into the buffer, it wakes up the sleeping consumer.
An inadequate solution could result in a deadlock where both processes are waiting to be awakened.



## Lambda

Lambda expressions basically express instances of functional interfaces (An interface with single abstract method is called functional interface. An example is java.lang.Runnable). lambda expressions implement the only abstract function and therefore implement functional interfaces

lambda expressions are added in Java 8 and provide below functionalities.

Enable to treat functionality as a method argument, or code as data.
A function that can be created without belonging to any class.
A lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.



## Stream

Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
The features of Java stream are 

 - A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
 - Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
 - Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.

**Intermediate Operations:**

1. **map:** The map method is used to returns a stream consisting of the results of applying the given function to the elements of this stream.
   `List number = Arrays.asList(2,3,4,5);List square = number.stream().map(x->x*x).collect(Collectors.toList());`
2. **filter:** The filter method is used to select elements as per the Predicate passed as argument.
   `List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");List result = names.stream().filter(s->s.startsWith("S")).collect(Collectors.toList());`
3. **sorted:** The sorted method is used to sort the stream.
   `List names = Arrays.asList("Reflection","Collection","Stream");List result = names.stream().sorted().collect(Collectors.toList());`



## Serialization

Serialization is a mechanism of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. Deserialization is the reverse process where the byte stream is used to recreate the actual Java object in memory. This mechanism is used to persist the object.
The byte stream created is platform independent. So, the object serialized on one platform can be deserialized on a different platform.
To make a Java object serializable we implement the java.io.Serializable interface.
The ObjectOutputStream class contains writeObject() method for serializing an Object.



## **Cloneable**

**Object Cloning** is a process of generating the exact field-to-field copy of object with the different name. The cloned object has its own space in the memory where it copies the content of the original object. That’s why when we change the content of original object after cloning, the changes does not reflect in the clone object. To achieve, we need implament Cloneable interface

Cloneable interface is present in java.lang package. There is a method clone() in [Object] class. A class that implements the Cloneable interface indicates that it is legal for clone() method to make a field-for-field copy of instances of that class.
Invoking Object’s clone method on an instance of the class that does not implement the Cloneable interface results in an exception CloneNotSupportedException being thrown. By convention, classes that implement this interface should override Object.clone() method.



## signleton in java

In object-oriented programming, a singleton class is a class that can have only one object (an instance of the class) at a time.
After first time, if we try to instantiate the Singleton class, the new variable also points to the first instance created. So whatever modifications we do to any variable inside the class through any instance, it affects the variable of the single instance created and is visible if we access that variable through any variable of that class type defined.
To design a singleton class:

1. Make constructor as private.
2. Write a static method that has return type object of this singleton class. Here, the concept of Lazy initialization is used to write this static method.
